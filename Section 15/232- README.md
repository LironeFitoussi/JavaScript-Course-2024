# Planning Your Web Application: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of web development, proper planning is crucial before writing a single line of code. This guide will walk you through the process of planning a web application project, using the "Mapty" project as an example.

## Introduction

Planning is essential for any project, especially for more complex web applications. In the real world, starting with a planning phase helps avoid confusion and problems down the road. This guide will demonstrate a planning process that works well for small to medium-sized projects.

## The Planning Process

Our planning process consists of four main steps:

1. User Stories
2. Features
3. Flowchart
4. Architecture

Let's dive into each of these steps in detail.

## User Stories

User stories are descriptions of the application's functionality from the user's perspective. They help describe the entire application's functionality and allow developers to determine the exact features that need to be implemented.

The format for a user story is:

"As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [get a benefit]."

For the Mapty application, here are some example user stories:

1. As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace, and steps per minute, so that I can keep a log of all my running.
2. As a user, I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain, so I can keep a log of all my cycling.
3. As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance so I can easily track my progress over time.
4. As a user, I want to see all my workouts on a map so I can easily check where I work out the most.
5. As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can keep using the app over time.

## Features

Based on the user stories, we can determine the necessary features for our application:

1. Map where users can click to add a new workout
2. Geolocation to display the map at the user's current location
3. Form to input workout data (running and cycling)
4. Display workouts in a list
5. Display workouts on the map
6. Store workout data in the browser (using local storage)
7. Read stored data when the app loads
8. Move the map to a workout location when clicked in the list

## Flowchart

A flowchart helps visualize the different actions a user can take and how the program reacts to these actions. It shows how data flows across the application and which events need to be implemented.

Here's a textual representation of a simplified flowchart for the Mapty app:

1. Page Load
   - Get user's location (async)
   - Render map centered on user's location
2. User interacts with map
   - User clicks on map
   - Display form to input workout data
3. User submits form
   - Render workout on map
   - Render workout in list
   - Store workout in local storage
4. Page load (continued)
   - Get workouts from local storage
   - Render workouts on map
   - Render workouts in list
5. User interacts with workout list
   - User clicks workout in list
   - Move map to workout location

## Architecture

The architecture defines how we will organize our code and what JavaScript features we'll use. It's the structure that holds all the code together.

For the Mapty project, we'll start by implementing features according to the flowchart and then refine the architecture as needed. This approach allows for flexibility and experimentation before settling on a final structure.

## Implementation Example

Let's implement the geolocation feature as an example of how we might start coding our application:

```javascript
class App {
  #map;
  #mapEvent;

  constructor() {
    this._getPosition();
  }

  _getPosition() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        this._loadMap.bind(this),
        function() {
          alert('Could not get your position');
        }
      );
    }
  }

  _loadMap(position) {
    const { latitude } = position.coords;
    const { longitude } = position.coords;
    const coords = [latitude, longitude];

    this.#map = L.map('map').setView(coords, 13);

    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.fr/hot/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
      attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo(this.#map);

    this.#map.on('click', this._showForm.bind(this));
  }

  _showForm(mapE) {
    this.#mapEvent = mapE;
    // Code to display the form
  }
}

const app = new App();
```

This code demonstrates how to implement the geolocation feature and load a map centered on the user's location using the Leaflet library.

## Conclusion

Planning your web application before diving into code is essential for creating a well-structured and maintainable project. By following the steps outlined in this guide - defining user stories, determining features, creating a flowchart, and considering architecture - you'll be well-prepared to tackle your next web development project efficiently and effectively.

Remember that planning is an iterative process, and it's okay to refine your plan as you progress through the implementation phase. The key is to have a solid foundation that guides your development process and helps you create a user-friendly, functional web application.

As you gain more experience, you'll become more proficient at planning and implementing web applications. Don't stress too much about creating perfect plans from the start - practice and experience will help you improve over time.
